# HackerRank Solutions

You will find here my proposed solutions for (some) HackerRank questions.

## Getting Started

Looking for the answer yourself first would be a good start ! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

### Prerequisites

Knowing C++ and Python won't hurt...

## About these solutions

All answers passed the questions' test cases and scored the maximum possible amount.

A decent amount of effort was put into keeping execution time and memory space in check.

I left only the required headers to run the solution on HackerRank.

All C++ code passed [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/visualstudio/ "SonarLint for Visual Studio")'s inspection, excluding warnings about using std::cin and std::cout.

## Why did you use Python on some answers ?

While I'm more familiar with C++, I occasionally used Python when I felt it would result in leaner, more readable code.

## Checking solutions

Copy-paste the proposed solution to HackerRank's 'Current Buffer' and test it ¯\\_\_(ツ)_\_/¯
