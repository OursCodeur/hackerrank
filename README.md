# HackerRank Solutions

You will find here my proposed solutions for (some) HackerRank questions.

## Getting Started

Looking for the answer yourself first would be a good start !

### Prerequisites

Knowing C++ and Python wouldn't hurt...

## About these solutions

All answers passed the questions' test cases and scored the maximum possible amount.
A decent amount of effort was put into keeping execution time and memory space in check.

## Why did you use Python on some answers ?

While I'm more familiar with C++, I occasionally used Python when I felt it would result in leaner, more readable code.

## Checking solutions

Copy-paste the proposed solution to HackerRank's 'Current Buffer' and test it ¯\\_\_(ツ)_\_/¯
